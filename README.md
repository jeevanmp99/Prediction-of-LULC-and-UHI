# Urban Heat Island Analysis – Greater Kovai

This repository presents the results and datasets from my academic research **“Urban Heat Island Analysis in the Greater Kovai Region”**, which examines how land use dynamics influence Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Urban Heat Island (UHI) intensity using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques.

Overview
Rapid urban growth and climate change have intensified local temperature variations in the Greater Kovai area. This study investigates how changes in Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) impact LST patterns and UHI intensity over time, combining spatial data analysis and predictive modeling.

Key Findings

1. Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Dynamics
- Significant expansion of **built-up areas** between 2016 and 2024, mainly around central and semi-urban zones.  
- **Vegetation and agricultural lands** showed a declining trend, while **barren land** slightly fluctuated.  
- Built-up area projected to rise from **~14% in 2016** to **~18% by 2032**, indicating steady urban sprawl.

2. Land Surface Temperature (LST) Patterns
- **Built-up** and **barren** lands recorded the **highest LST values**, exceeding 38–40 °C.  
- **Vegetation and water bodies** exhibited **lowest LST values**, averaging 26–30 °C.  
- Mean LST has shown a continuous increase from 2016 to 2024.  
- The **area under >40 °C zones** is projected to increase from **156 km² (2016)** to **235 km² (2032)**.

3. UHI Intensity Distribution
- UHI intensity classes were divided into five categories: *very low*, *low*, *moderate*, *high*, and *very high*.  
- 2016–2024 data showed a gradual shift from *low* to *moderate/high* intensity zones, concentrated in built-up regions.  
- Forecast results indicated short-term cooling in some green-covered areas, but overall warming trends continued in core urban clusters.

Predictive Modeling
- **Model Used:** CA-ANN (Cellular Automata–Artificial Neural Network) implemented in QGIS  
- **Predicted Years:** 2028 and 2032  
- The CA-ANN simulation demonstrated strong correlation between LULC expansion and LST rise, validating the model’s capability for UHI forecasting.

Interpretation
The results confirm that **urban expansion is a major driver of surface temperature increase** in Greater Kovai.  
Green spaces and water bodies act as effective cooling agents.  
Findings emphasize the need for **urban greening, reflective roofing, and sustainable land use planning** to mitigate future heat stress.

Data & Tools
- **Software:** QGIS, ArcMap, Google Earth Engine  
- **Models/Methods:** CA-ANN, Split-Window Algorithm, LULC Classification (Random Forest)  
- **Data Sources:** Landsat 8/9 imagery (2016 – 2024)
